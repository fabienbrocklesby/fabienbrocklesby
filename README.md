## Software Engineer • Product Builder • NZ

Kia ora, I design and ship clean, fast, reliable software. I care about first-run experience, robustness at the edges, and keeping stacks lean so teams can move quickly.

### About
- Builder at heart, product-minded, obsessed with time-to-value and maintainability.
- Founder of Light Lane (modern laser engraving software), public release now live.
- Based in Nelson/Christchurch, New Zealand.

### What I’m good at
- Turning vague ideas into shippable, minimal products.
- Desktop and web apps that feel native and load fast.
- Integrations, licensing, data flows, and “it just works” operations.
- Testing strategies that catch edge cases without slowing delivery.

### Principles
- Ship small, ship often.
- Readable > clever.
- Measure outcomes, not lines of code.
- Own failures, harden the edges, automate the boring parts.

### Now
- Growing an early user base, refining onboarding and reliability.
- Open to short, high-impact build sprints and technical advisories where speed matters.
